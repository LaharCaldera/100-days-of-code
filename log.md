# 100 Days Of Code - 2019 - Log

### Day 1: March 15

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 items and started the Introduction to Basic CSS, concluding the first five items.

**Thoughts:** I had an initial difficulty with nesting and in the first few lines I insisted on putting semicolon at the end of everything. The methodology and respectful rhythm of the freecodecamp helped me a lot to stay focused so that I was naturally adapting myself. The terms used although grammatically similar to everyday, seem to dance with the tags, this made everything as interesting as dangerous and delayed me a little ... That is, a paradox: The best thing in a challenge!

## Day 2: March 16

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** I was a few minutes late because I hesitated in understanding the Fallback value to a CSS Variable. When I knew what to do, I did not know exactly where to put it. I confess that it made me laugh at myself sometimes. The second day was much warmer! CSS is addictive.

## Day 3: March 17

**Today's Progress**: Started Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts:** My purpose was to finish "Applied Visual Design". But today, I had to be more present in my son's life. I'm leaving nine extra items for tomorrow, with great joy for that.
