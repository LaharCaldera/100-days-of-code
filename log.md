# 100 Days Of Code - 2019 - Log

### Day 1: March 15

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 items and started the Introduction to Basic CSS, concluding the first five items.

**Thoughts:** I had an initial difficulty with nesting and in the first few lines I insisted on putting semicolon at the end of everything. The methodology and respectful rhythm of the freecodecamp helped me a lot to stay focused so that I was naturally adapting myself. The terms used although grammatically similar to everyday, seem to dance with the tags, this made everything as interesting as dangerous and delayed me a little ... That is, a paradox: The best thing in a challenge!

## Day 2: March 16

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** I was a few minutes late because I hesitated in understanding the Fallback value to a CSS Variable. When I knew what to do, I did not know exactly where to put it. I confess that it made me laugh at myself sometimes. The second day was much warmer! CSS is addictive.

## Day 3: March 17

**Today's Progress**: Started Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts:** My purpose was to finish "Applied Visual Design". But today, I had to be more present in my son's life. I'm leaving nine extra items for tomorrow, with great joy for that.

## Day 4: March 18

**Today's Progress**: Applied Visual Design and Applied Accessibility completed!

**Thoughts:** I'm on the fourth day and I'm still surprised. The dialectical relationship between my person and knowledge is being given to me, could not be better. For each step, a "welcome" and a "goodbye" to the doubts that before the learning process, it seemed to me an endless condition. I was surprised by the Bezier curve, in how it makes the movement more harmonious.I had fun grouping elements with fieldset and improving accessibility with Landmark.I was happy , because there is nothing better than appreciate the main content with your element . =) I felt safe when I learned that I can improve content using the article element. I was feel great recognizing and identifying the figcaption element nested to the figure element to construct the independence of specific content, related to the main content. I found difficulties, but I did not lose focus. Let's move on! I look forward to the next topic.

## Day 5: March 19

**Today's Progress**: Responsive Web Design Principles completed.

**Thoughts:** I had difficulty with Responsive Web Design Principles. It took me to finish the last two items. What helped me to make it simple were the previous concepts, in particular, of the basic properties of css. How basic is important!

## Day 6: March 20

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** I believe that with Flexbox you can create and organize layouts with CSS3 in a very elegant way. Through its properties / possibilities, I realized that tasks can be achieved with very few lines of code.

## Day 7: March 21

**Today's Progress**: CSS Grid completed.

**Thoughts:** We can more easily determine the reading stream.
The grid helps us design the harmonious ones by balancing the weights of the graphic elements of the layout.
Help position the elements more accurately.

## Day 8: March 22

**Today's Progress**: "Build a Tribute Page" completed.

**Thoughts:** Today was deliberately challenging. I considered the rules, though I felt like breaking a few. I may have broken it from trying so hard to follow them. One of the things that most appeals to me in the world code is precisely this incredible possibility of freedom. Anyway, very happy. I've encountered difficulties, of course. I'm a good beginner.

## Day 9: March 23

**Today's Progress**: "Tribute Page" github repository.

**Thoughts:** Today I decided to reinforce the knowledge by creating a github repository with the content of the previous challenge.
It is using [express to serve the static files](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/starter/static-files.html).

## Day 10: March 24

**Today's Progress**: Building a Survey Form.(work in progress)

**Thoughts:** After a race at a pace incomprehensible to me of assimilation of isolated knowledge, I saw myself in another level: to organize everything.Being cautious has helped me focus on the details, I'm taking it easy, and a hurry just to make everything simpler. But today, better than yesterday, I felt progress in relation to to the pace I need.

## Day 11: March 25

**Today's Progress**: Survey Form completed.

**Thoughts:** My experience today was sensational, especially when my submit button disappeared. I thought: OMG. The web development's discipline is causing me a tremendous good mood. After a few frustrating attempts, a "noob" feeling became more and more present, then I decided to impose myself with a peculiar simplicity.

## Day 12: March 26

**Today's Progress**: "Survey Form" github repository/ Starting build of Product Landing Page.

**Thoughts:** I like the initiations of projects, they always raise the possibility of the permanence of something beautiful. Of course, for this to happen, we need to devote time. I followed steps similar to the previous one: I used node.js and express as static file server, prepared the html structure and I am observing it as the one that decides, in all beginner joy, how the structures will "dance".

## Day 13: March 27

**Today's Progress**: Build of Product Landing Page.(work in progress)

## Day 14: March 28

**Today's Progress**: Build of Product Landing Page.(work in progress)

**Thoughts:** Acquiring knowledge is something valuable. But holding on to organizing them is sublime, requiring depth. It's like a second affirmation of your goal. I confess, this part has been the hardest part of me. In programming itself, in what I felt in deep freedom, I committed to the value of the code, in the discipline, so that my code never looked like what it should be, although it works. This is so funny, because I felt so good programming messy loops. It's like feeling you know how to drive well and be disapproved in the traffic test for not knowing the proper procedure in practice. I feel that the initiative of the 100 days of the code is taking me where I always wanted to be, but I did not know where to start. Today was to put my "landing page" that was not at all responsive and not pretty, in github- with the promise of daily implementation until it is good for me, and organizational study day on Grid and Flexbox. Going back is not an option. That's when I can say gently: Forward.

## Day 15: March 29

**Today's Progress**: Landing Page Completed(Missing a super grid in my menu)


**Thoughts:** The curious case for me in today's progress has been to keep each other within the boundaries with the code. You wait for the answer to continue, as in a dance, so maybe my menu has not been responsive (laughs). But I realized with the feat, so simple, so true. Tomorrow I try again and again .... Today was the day to investigate, to order and to transform. Happy.

## Day 16: March 30

**Today's Progress**: Training grid and Flexbox.


**Thoughts:** Today was a day of break between projects, I decided to extend the "Saturday night fever" taking advantage of all the charm that Grid and Flexbox promote me. Why do I like it so much? Because it is necessary to be lived like this. And these things are invaluable. I researched, messed, solved and customized examples. I mixed it as someone does at a party, enchanted by the scent of flowers. It's working!
