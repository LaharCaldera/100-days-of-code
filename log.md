# 100 Days Of Code - 2019 - Log

### Day 1: March 15

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 items and started the Introduction to Basic CSS, concluding the first five items.

**Thoughts:** I had an initial difficulty with nesting and in the first few lines I insisted on putting semicolon at the end of everything. The methodology and respectful rhythm of the freecodecamp helped me a lot to stay focused so that I was naturally adapting myself. The terms used although grammatically similar to everyday, seem to dance with the tags, this made everything as interesting as dangerous and delayed me a little ... That is, a paradox: The best thing in a challenge!

## Day 2: March 16

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** I was a few minutes late because I hesitated in understanding the Fallback value to a CSS Variable. When I knew what to do, I did not know exactly where to put it. I confess that it made me laugh at myself sometimes. The second day was much warmer! CSS is addictive.

## Day 3: March 17

**Today's Progress**: Started Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts:** My purpose was to finish "Applied Visual Design". But today, I had to be more present in my son's life. I'm leaving nine extra items for tomorrow, with great joy for that.

## Day 4: March 18

**Today's Progress**: Applied Visual Design and Applied Accessibility completed!

**Thoughts:** I'm on the fourth day and I'm still surprised. The dialectical relationship between my person and knowledge is being given to me, could not be better. For each step, a "welcome" and a "goodbye" to the doubts that before the learning process, it seemed to me an endless condition. I was surprised by the Bezier curve, in how it makes the movement more harmonious.I had fun grouping elements with fieldset and improving accessibility with Landmark.I was happy , because there is nothing better than appreciate the main content with your element . =) I felt safe when I learned that I can improve content using the article element. I was feel great recognizing and identifying the figcaption element nested to the figure element to construct the independence of specific content, related to the main content. I found difficulties, but I did not lose focus. Let's move on! I look forward to the next topic.
